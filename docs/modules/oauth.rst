OAuth Module
============

The OAuth module connects to the OAuth implementation in midgard-core and provides
functionalities related to authentication, e.g., logging in using the password flow,
logging out, retrieving and saving the access token.

Buildly React Template uses the actions defined in `/src/redux/authuser/actions/authuser.actions.js` to access
these functionalities within the components.
